For accessing the dashboard you should sign in with any email and password.
This project was done using the following:

       - CSS(Responsive web development with Bootstrap)
       - SASS(SCSS files have not been included to this project to minimize the size of the project)
       - Vanilla Javascript

This page is responsive and it has many Javascript functionalities. These functionalities include:
       - A gallery viewer appears when you click an image in the gallery(Home Page)
       - A search bar(Dashboard - Find People Section)
       - When you click the add article, book or images button it opens a form within the page itself(Dashboard - Add Media Section)
